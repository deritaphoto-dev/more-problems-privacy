Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 24, 2026 App Name: More Problems 
1. Overview
More Problems (“the App”) is an educational math practice app that provides multiple-choice problem runs and tracks high scores. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it’s used, and your choices.
2. Information We Collect
A. Information Stored Locally on Your Device
The App stores certain gameplay data locally on your device (e.g., high score history, run results, difficulty history). This data is stored using Apple’s local storage (e.g., UserDefaults).
* This data is stored on-device
* It is not uploaded to a developer-operated server
* Deleting the App removes this local data (unless you restore via device backup)
B. Advertising Data (Google AdMob)
The App uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob and its partners may automatically collect and process information to provide and measure ads, including:
* Device identifiers (such as IDFA if you allow tracking, or other identifiers permitted by the platform)
* Approximate location (derived from IP address or device settings, depending on configuration)
* Ad interaction data (views, clicks, performance metrics)
* Diagnostic information (crash data, performance data)
* Other technical data (device type, OS version, language, network information)
This data may be used for:
* Serving ads (personalized or non-personalized)
* Frequency capping (limiting repeated ads)
* Ad fraud prevention and security
* Reporting and analytics for ad performance
C. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) / IDFA
If you choose “Allow” when prompted by Apple’s tracking permission dialog, the App (via AdMob and supported ad networks) may access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to help deliver personalized ads and to measure ad effectiveness across apps and websites.
If you choose “Ask App Not to Track”:
* The App will still show ads
* Ads may be non-personalized
* The App will not access the IDFA for tracking purposes
3. How We Use Information
We use information to:
* Provide app functionality (gameplay and high scores stored locally)
* Display ads through AdMob
* Measure ad performance and improve reliability (e.g., diagnostics)
We do not require account creation and we do not sell personal information.
4. Sharing of Information
We do not run our own backend for user data. However, when ads are shown, information may be shared with:
* Google AdMob (Google LLC) and its advertising partners for ad delivery, measurement, fraud prevention, and analytics.
The data shared depends on whether you allow tracking and your device settings.
5. Your Choices & Controls
A. Tracking Permission (iOS)
You can control tracking at any time:
* iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking → toggle for the App
B. Ad Personalization
If you deny tracking, ads may be non-personalized. Some non-personalized ads may still use contextual signals (like app content, general location, or device type).
C. Deleting Local Data
You can remove locally stored game data by deleting the App from your device.
6. Children’s Privacy
The App is educational and may be used by students. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for our own use. However, ads served by AdMob may collect device data as described above.
If the App is directed to children under 13 (or you intend it for kids), you must configure AdMob and App Store settings accordingly (for example, disabling personalized ads and enabling child-directed treatment). If you plan to target children, contact us and we will update the policy and configuration.
7. Data Security
We do not store user personal data on our own servers. Ad-related data is handled by Google and its partners under their security practices.
8. International Users
If you use the App outside the United States, ad partners may process data in other countries. Data processing is handled by Google/partners according to their policies and applicable laws.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy as features change. Updates will be posted with a new effective date.
